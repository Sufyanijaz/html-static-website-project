        <strong>Silent Hill 2 Remake</strong> is widely regarded as one of the
        most psychologically complex horror games ever created.<br />
        Unlike traditional horror games that rely on jump scares, Silent Hill 2
        focuses on <em>guilt, trauma, denial, and self-punishment</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website explores the characters of Silent Hill 2 not as simple game
        entities,<br />
        but as symbolic representations of the protagonist’s inner struggles.

              <p>
                <strong>James Sunderland</strong> is the protagonist of Silent
                Hill 2. He appears as an ordinary man, but his journey reveals a
                deeply conflicted individual struggling with grief, denial, and
                guilt.
              </p>

              <h4>Psychological Complexity</h4>
              <p>
                James’s perception of reality is unreliable. The town of Silent
                Hill adapts itself to his subconscious, manifesting creatures
                and events that reflect his emotional state. His calm demeanor
                hides a mind that is actively suppressing the truth.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Pyramid Head</strong> is one of the most iconic figures
                in horror gaming.<br />
                While often mistaken as the main villain, he serves a much
                deeper symbolic role within the narrative.
              </p>

              <h3>Symbolism and Purpose</h3>
              <p>
                Pyramid Head represents James Sunderland’s desire for
                punishment. His appearance is based on executioners from Silent
                Hill’s history, emphasizing judgment rather than evil intent.
              </p>

              <h4>Was Pyramid Head Helping James?</h4>
              <p>
                Although violent, Pyramid Head forces James to confront
                uncomfortable truths. He does not kill James directly, instead
                pushing him toward realization. Once James accepts his guilt,
                Pyramid Head disappears, indicating his purpose has been
                fulfilled.

              <h3>MARIA</h3>
                    </font>
              <p>
                <strong>Maria</strong> appears to be a woman who looks almost
                identical to James Sunderland’s deceased wife, Mary. However,
                her personality, behavior, and presence differ in unsettling
                ways.
              </p>

              <h4>Symbolic Role</h4>
              <p>
                Maria represents James’s denial and desire. She embodies an
                idealized version of Mary — more affectionate, more available,
                and free from illness. Her existence highlights James’s
                inability to accept reality.
              </p>

              <h4>Repeated Deaths and Meaning</h4>
              <p>
                Maria repeatedly dies throughout the story, often in brutal
                ways. These deaths symbolize the fact that James cannot maintain
                his illusion. Each loss forces him closer to the truth he is
                trying to escape.
              </p>

              <h4>Psychological Interpretation</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>She remembers events inconsistently</li>
                <li>Her emotions change suddenly</li>
                <li>She questions her own existence near the end</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Maria is not meant to survive because she is not real in a
                traditional sense. She exists solely as a product of James’s
                mind and guilt.
              </p>

          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          Maria demonstrates that Silent Hill can create illusions of comfort
          and desire. She challenges the protagonist to confront his longing and
          guilt, showing that hope can be seductive but ultimately unstable.

                    </font>
              <p>
                <strong>Angela Orosco</strong> is a deeply tragic character
                whose story represents trauma, abuse, and self-blame. Her
                presence shows that Silent Hill manifests differently for each
                individual.
              </p>

              <h4>Personal Hell</h4>
              <p>
                Unlike James, Angela’s version of Silent Hill is constantly
                burning. Fire symbolizes her inner pain, anger, and suffering
                caused by years of abuse.
              </p>

              <h4>Connection to the Theme of Guilt</h4>
              <p>
                Angela believes she deserves punishment despite being a victim.
                This contrasts with James, who struggles to accept
                responsibility. Their encounters highlight different responses
                to trauma.
              </p>

              <h4>Environmental Storytelling</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Fire imagery represents emotional torment</li>
                <li>Distorted rooms reflect mental instability</li>
                <li>
                  Her final scene suggests surrender rather than resolution
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Angela’s story reinforces the idea that Silent Hill does not
                judge — it reflects what already exists within a person.
              </p>

        <p>
          Angela’s fate illustrates how Silent Hill exposes the weight of past
          trauma. She cannot escape the darkness within, showing that unresolved
          pain and guilt can consume a person completely.

          <strong>Laura</strong> is a young girl encountered in Silent Hill 2.
          Unlike other characters, she appears emotionally unaffected by the
          town’s horrors, behaving mischievously and confidently.
        </p>

        <h4>Psychological Role</h4>
        <p>
          Laura represents innocence and emotional clarity. Because she carries
          no guilt or inner darkness, Silent Hill does not manifest monsters or
          fear for her. Her presence contrasts sharply with James’s mental
          torment.

                <strong>Eddie Dombrowski</strong> represents what happens when
                isolation, humiliation, and resentment turn into violence. He
                serves as a mirror of what James could become if he refuses
                accountability.

              <h4>Descent into Violence</h4>
              <p>
                Eddie initially appears frightened and defensive. Over time, he
                becomes increasingly hostile, eventually embracing violence as
                justification for his actions.

          Eddie’s fate demonstrates that Silent Hill does not force redemption.
          It merely reveals who a person truly is.

   <!-- SUMMARY -->
    <section id="summary">
      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
        This project explored the characters of
        <strong>Silent Hill 2 Remake</strong>
        through a psychological and symbolic perspective rather than a
        gameplay-focused approach. Each character was analyzed as a reflection
        of inner conflict, trauma, or guilt.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>James Sunderland</strong> represents denial and suppressed
        truth, while <strong>Pyramid Head</strong> serves as a manifestation of
        punishment and judgment. Characters such as <strong>Maria</strong>,
        <strong>Angela Orosco</strong>, and
        <strong>Eddie Dombrowski</strong> further demonstrate how Silent Hill
        adapts itself to the mental state of each individual.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through environmental storytelling, symbolism, and subtle narrative
        hints, Silent Hill 2 presents horror as a psychological experience
        rather than a purely visual one. The characters are not merely part of
        the story — they are the story.
